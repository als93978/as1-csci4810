The basic line drawing algorithm is implemented in the drawLineBasic(int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1) function. Given the two end points coordinates, it figures out what pixels to activate on the display to approximate the true line. It does this by calculating the slope and using the point-slope formula of a line to calculate the next x or y value, truncates it, and draws a pixel at that (x, y) point. It is not very efficient because it uses floating point values, multiplication, and division in its calculations, which are expensive operations. However, it does draw lines correctly.
